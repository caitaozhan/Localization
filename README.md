# Localization

Multiple transmitter localization

# TODO
## testbed (Done)
1. interpolation error: for outdoors, need to remove part of the training data to act as the ground truth) (10.16)
2. power error: for indoors (...) (10.16)
3. localization error: add cluster in the plot (10.19)


## synthetic
1. plots for various amount of training. do not use multi-granularity. pick a default amount of training. (10.16-17) (Done)
2. plots for various amount of intruders. (10.18-10.19)
3. plots for various amount of sensors density. (10.20)
